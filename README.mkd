jsonxx is a C++ library for parsing JSON data.

The primary goals of jsonxx include:
  * simple interface and implementation
  * integration with C++ STL interfaces
  * type safety of the parsed data

Speed is not an explicit goal, however, that is not an excuse for bad
performance due to inefficient algorithms or data structures.

Patches to fix bugs or TODO items are more than welcome.
